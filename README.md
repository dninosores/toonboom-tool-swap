# Toonboom Tool-Swap

Adds a couple useful hotkeys to ToonBoom:
- You can use one key to activate both the pencil and brush tools, and another key to switch which one is active
- You can bind hotkeys to the cutter and select tools without affecting what `alt` does

The new hotkeys are in the hotkeys menu under `Dninosores TBToolSwap`.

# Installation
Create a folder called `packages` in your user scripts directory if it doesn't already exist, then copy the `TBToolSwap` folder into it.
